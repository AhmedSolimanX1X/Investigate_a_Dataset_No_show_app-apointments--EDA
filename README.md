# Investigate_a_Dataset_No_show_appointments


## Project Overview

In this project, We will analyze a dataset  and then communicate the  findings about it. We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make the analysis easier.


### Dataset Description 

> This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment,The original source of data can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments).
